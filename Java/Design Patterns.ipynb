    "# Q1. SOLID Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that help make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. They were introduced by Robert C. Martin, commonly known as Uncle Bob.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Definition: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Explanation: Each class should handle a single part of the functionality. This avoids class bloat and makes the code easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Example: If you have a class Invoice that handles generating an invoice, saving it to a database, and sending it over email, this class violates SRP. Instead, you can split these into separate classes like InvoiceGenerator, InvoiceRepository, and InvoiceMailer, each handling its own responsibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "       // Violates SRP: Class handles multiple responsibilities\n",
    "        public class InvoiceProcessor {\n",
    "            public void createInvoice() { /* Create invoice logic */ }\n",
    "            public void saveToDatabase() { /* Database save logic */ }\n",
    "            public void sendEmail() { /* Email logic */ }\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Adheres to SRP\n",
    "\n",
    "        public class InvoiceGenerator {\n",
    "            public void createInvoice() { /* Create invoice logic */ }\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "        public class InvoiceRepository {\n",
    "            public void saveToDatabase() { /* Database save logic */ }\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "        public class EmailService {\n",
    "            public void sendEmail() { /* Email logic */ }\n",
    "        }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP):\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Definition: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Explanation: You should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code, which reduces the risk of introducing bugs into working code.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Example: If a DiscountCalculator class calculates discounts for different user types, you can extend it to support new user types by creating new subclasses rather than modifying the existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "        // Base class (closed for modification)\n",
    "\n",
    "        public abstract class DiscountCalculator {\n",
    "            public abstract double calculateDiscount(double amount);\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "        // Extendable classes for different discount types (open for extension)\n",
    "\n",
    "        public class RegularDiscount extends DiscountCalculator {\n",
    "            public double calculateDiscount(double amount) {\n",
    "                return amount * 0.1; // 10% discount\n",
    "            }\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "        public class SeasonalDiscount extends DiscountCalculator {\n",
    "            public double calculateDiscount(double amount) {\n",
    "                return amount * 0.2; // 20% discount\n",
    "            }\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "        public class DiscountService {\n",
    "            public void applyDiscount(DiscountCalculator calculator, double amount) {\n",
    "                System.out.println(\"Discounted amount: \" + calculator.calculateDiscount(amount));\n",
    "            }\n",
    "        }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Definition: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.\n",
    "      - If class B is subtype of class A, then we should be able to replace object of A with B without breaking the behaviour of the program.\n",
    "      - Subclass should extend the capability of the parent class but not narrow it down.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Explanation: Any derived class should be able to replace its parent class without affecting the program’s correctness. This ensures compatibility with polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Example: If you have a Bird class and a Penguin subclass, LSP is violated if Penguin cannot fly() (if fly() is in the Bird interface). A solution might be to refactor the design by creating a FlyingBird interface for birds that can fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "        \n",
    "    interface  Bike {\n",
    "        void turnOnEngine();\n",
    "        void accelerate();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Violates LSP\n",
    "    class Bicycle implements Bike {\n",
    "\n",
    "        @Override\n",
    "        public void turnOnEngine() {\n",
    "            throw new AssertionError(\"There is no bike.\");\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",

    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    class Motorcycle implements  Bike {\n",
    "\n",
    "        boolean isEngineOn;\n",
    "        int speed;\n",
    "\n",
    "        @Override\n",
    "        public void turnOnEngine() {\n",
    "            isEngineOn = true;\n",

    "\n",
    "        @Override\n",
    "        public void accelerate() {\n",
    "            speed = speed + 10;\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here, Bicycle violates LSP because bike doesn't have engine and it's narrowing down the parent class behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Definition: Interfcaes should be such that client should not implement unnecessary functions they don't need.\n",
    "   - Explanation: It’s better to create smaller, more specific interfaces rather than a large, general-purpose interface that forces clients to implement methods they don’t need.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Example: If you have a Machine interface with print(), scan(), and fax() methods, but a Printer only needs print(), consider splitting it into Printer, Scanner, and FaxMachine interfaces.\n",

    "Here, the Developer and Manager classes can choose the interfaces they need without being forced to implement methods that are irrelevant to them.\n",
    "\n",

    "Types of Factory Pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple Factory:\n",
    "   - A single method is used to create different types of objects.\n",
    "   - The above example is a simple factory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Factory Method:\n",
    "   - Subclasses override a factory method to specify the type of object that will be created.\n",
    "   - Commonly uses an abstract class or interface for the factory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract Factory:\n",
    "   - A factory of factories; it provides a way to create families of related objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "   - Encapsulation: The object creation logic is centralized in the factory.\n",
    "   - Loose Coupling: The client code depends on the interface, not the concrete implementations.\n",
    "   - Open/Closed Principle: Adding new shapes does not require modifying the client code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "   - Complexity: The pattern introduces an extra layer of abstraction, which may seem overkill for simple scenarios.\n",
    "   - Scalability Issue in Simple Factory: If too many types are added, the factory class can become unwieldy.\n"

    "# Q4. Singleton Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The Singleton Pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. It is often used to manage shared resources, such as a database connection, logging service, or configuration manager, where only a single instance is required throughout the application's lifecycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concepts:\n",
    "   - Single Instance: Only one instance of the class is created.\n",
    "   - Global Access Point: Provides a way to access the instance globally.\n",
    "   - Thread Safety: Ensures that the instance creation is safe in a multithreaded environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Eager Initialization Singleton:\n",
    "\n",
    "The instance is created at the time of class loading.\n",
    "\n",
    "public class EagerSingleton {\n",
    "    // Single instance is created eagerly\n",
    "    private static final EagerSingleton INSTANCE = new EagerSingleton();\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation\n",
    "    private EagerSingleton() {}\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Global access point\n",
    "    public static EagerSingleton getInstance() {\n",
    "        return INSTANCE;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Pros: Simple and thread-safe since the instance is created during class loading.\n",
    "   - Cons: Instance is created even if it is never used, leading to resource wastage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Lazy Initialization Singleton:\n",
    "\n",
    "The instance is created only when it is needed.\n",

    "public class LazySingleton {\n",

    "        }\n",
    "        return instance;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Pros: Instance is created only when required, saving resources.\n",
    "   - Cons: Not thread-safe in a multithreaded environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Thread-Safe Singleton:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensures safe access in a multithreaded environment using synchronized.\n",
    "\n",
    "public class ThreadSafeSingleton {\n",
    "    private static ThreadSafeSingleton instance;\n",

    "        if (instance == null) {\n",
    "            instance = new ThreadSafeSingleton();\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        return instance;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
