    "# Q. In a linux vm, there is a process that need to be run always. There was an issue that application was not running? How to debug?\n",
    "\n",
    "When a critical process or application stops running on a Linux VM, debugging involves systematically checking various factors, from application-specific issues to system-level configurations. Below is a step-by-step guide to debug this issue:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Check if the Process is Running\n",
    "\n",
    "Use commands like ps or pgrep to confirm if the process is running.\n",
    "\n",
    "ps aux | grep <process_name>\n",
    "pgrep -fl <process_name>\n",
    "\n",
    "If the process is not found, it has stopped or failed to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Check Application Logs\n",
    "\n",
    "Most applications write logs that provide insight into their state. Look for errors in the logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "cat /var/log/<application_log_file>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don’t know the log location, check the application’s configuration files or documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Check the Exit Status\n",
    "\n",
    "If the process was executed manually, check its last exit code.\n",
    "\n",
    "echo $?\n",
    "\n",
    "0: Success\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-zero: Failure (Look up the application’s documentation for error codes).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Restart the Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Try restarting the process to see if it runs without errors.\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo systemctl restart <service_name>  # For systemd services\n",
    "./<application_binary>                # For manual execution\n",
    "```\n",
    "Monitor Logs During Restart:\n",
    "```\n",
    "journalctl -u <service_name> -f  # For systemd services\n",
    "tail -f /var/log/<application_log_file>  # Tail logs while restarting\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Check Resource Availability\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure the system has enough resources for the application:\n",
    "\n",
    "Disk Space:\n",
    "\n",
    "df -h\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Open Files Limit:\n",
    "\n",
    "ulimit -n\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Network and Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "If the application relies on external services or databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Check Network Connections:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ping <dependency_host>\n",
    "telnet <dependency_host> <port>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Check Dependency Status:\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo systemctl status <dependency_service>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Verify Configuration Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Misconfigured files can prevent the application from starting. Check for syntax errors or incorrect values.\n",
    "\n",
    "cat /path/to/config_file\n",
    "\n",
    "Use tools like cat, vi, or nano to inspect the files. Validate them if the application provides a built-in validator.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Check System Logs\n",
    "\n",
    "System logs might have clues about application failures:\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo journalctl -xe\n",
    "sudo dmesg | grep <process_name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "9. File Permissions\n",
    "Ensure the application binary and required files have the correct permissions.\n",
    "```\n",
    "ls -l /path/to/application\n",
    "ls -l /var/log/<application_log_file>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Check Crashed Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "If the process crashed, check for core dumps:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ulimit -c  # Ensure core dumps are enabled\n",
    "ls /var/lib/systemd/coredump/\n",
    "```\n",
    "Analyze the core dump (requires debugging tools):\n",
    "```\n",
    "gdb /path/to/application /path/to/core.dump\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Check Scheduled Jobs\n",
    "\n",
    "If the application should restart automatically, ensure a cron job or systemd timer is configured correctly:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cron Jobs:\n",
    "\n",
    "crontab -l\n",
    "\n",
    "Systemd Timers:\n",
    "\n",
    "sudo systemctl list-timers\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Enable Auto-Restart\n",
    "\n",
    "If the process should run continuously, configure it to auto-restart on failure:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/<service_name>.service\n",

    "Add:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Restart=always\n",
    "RestartSec=5\n",

    "Reload the systemd configuration:\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo systemctl daemon-reload\n",
    "sudo systemctl restart <service_name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "13. Check for Conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure no other process or service conflicts with the application:\n",
    "\n",
    "Check Ports:\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo netstat -tuln | grep <port>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Kill Conflicting Processes:\n",
    "\n",
    "sudo kill -9 <conflicting_pid>\n",
    "\n",
    "14. Consult Application Documentation or Support\n",
    "\n",
    "If none of the above resolves the issue, check:\n",
    "\n",
    "The official application documentation.\n",
    "Community forums or vendor support for known issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. Use Monitoring Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Set up tools like monit, supervisord, or systemd to monitor the process and automatically restart it if it fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Using monit to monitor and restart the application:\n",
    "\n",
    "sudo apt install monit\n",
    "sudo vi /etc/monit/monitrc\n",
    "\n",
